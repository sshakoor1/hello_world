# My first (no it's not) and simple repository
This is my first attempt to create a Git repository on GitHub (no it's not).
The goal here is to learn how to create and maintain a repository.
I am interested in (among other things):
- Creating a branch
- Working on the branch and committing my changes.
- Merging the branch to main
